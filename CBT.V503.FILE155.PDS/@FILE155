//***FILE 155 is from David North and contains two versions of      *   FILE 155
//*           the REXX reformatter exec.  In addition, there are    *   FILE 155
//*           other REXX execs, notably REXX8080, which can         *   FILE 155
//*           reformat VB-255 REXX execs so they can be made into   *   FILE 155
//*           FB-80 REXX execs that work the same way.              *   FILE 155

//* REXXREF and REXREF--------------------------------------------- *   FILE 155
//*     The two execs (ISPF edit macros) REXXREF and REXREF were    *   FILE 155
//*     written for VM CMS.  REXXREF is the full version, does      *   FILE 155
//*     reformatting and cross reference, and REXREF is the same    *   FILE 155
//*     with the cross reference code removed.  In both macros I    *   FILE 155
//*     disabled the VM code and replaced it with ISPF code.        *   FILE 155
//*     Not all of the options work, I have plans to make it all    *   FILE 155
//*     work.                                                       *   FILE 155
//*                                                                 *   FILE 155
//*     The default is to reformat and not attempt the cross        *   FILE 155
//*     reference.  It will indent 3 cols for each level of IF,     *   FILE 155
//*     DO, SELECT, etc.  Comments will be right adjusted to col    *   FILE 155
//*     73.  REXX reserved words will be capitalized with REXX      *   FILE 155
//*     functions in all caps.                                      *   FILE 155

//*     Here is the atttempt at converting REXX VB-255 files        *   FILE 155
//*     into FB-80 with correct continuation, REXX8080.             *   FILE 155
//*     REXX8080  - 09/28/99 - Reformat REXX program into 80 col    *   FILE 155
//*                 lines by breaking up lines longer than 80       *   FILE 155
//*                 into continuation lines.  Note: line without    *   FILE 155
//*                 blanks or "(", ")", or "=" is not split.        *   FILE 155
//*                                                                 *   FILE 155
//*                 Run this exec from ISPF edit and then move      *   FILE 155
//*                 the edited file to a FB-80 PDS.  Let the        *   FILE 155
//*                 truncation happen,  It's OK.  Everything        *   FILE 155
//*                 past col 80 is now blank.  Run REXREF or        *   FILE 155
//*                 REXXREF after REXX8080 to make it look nice.    *   FILE 155
//*                 Then re-run REXX8080 because the                *   FILE 155
//*                 reformatting may make long lines.               *   FILE 155

//*                 Use the file called JUNK to validate/test       *   FILE 155
//*                 REXX8080. First it must be moved to a FB-255    *   FILE 155
//*                 PDS and the lines concatenated back into long   *   FILE 155

//* OTHER STUFF---------------------------------------------------- *   FILE 155
//*     Here are some VM crutches:                                  *   FILE 155
//*     The SPLTJOIN exec is very useful when adding comments to    *   FILE 155

//*                 RESET to show all lines in the file. Syntax     *   FILE 155

//*        Hint:  Set a PF key, maybe PF14, to execute the          *   FILE 155
//*               VMSPLIT macro then you can simply                 *   FILE 155
